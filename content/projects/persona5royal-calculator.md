[Persona 5 royal calculator](https://github.com/YassineHaouzane/p5r_calculator) is a fullstack app inspired from this [website](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/indexRoyal.html#/list). 

This fullstack app serves data about the video game Persona 5 Royal especially about fusions.
In this video-game you can fuse 2 personas (which are like pokemons) to get a stronger persona.

[The backend](https://github.com/YassineHaouzane/p5r_calculator) has been implemented in Rust to compute fusions, [the frontend](https://github.com/YassineHaouzane/p5r_calculator_front) has been implemented with VueJs.
